\chapter{\RED{The Thief}}

Our half-elf rogue was born into a family of cow herders in a small rural 
village. They were not wealthy, but they made do with what they had. Growing 
up, our rogue learned the ins and outs of tending to the cows, and quickly 
became an expert in the field.

As the years went by, the rogue grew restless. The daily routine of tending to 
the cows had become monotonous and boring. Our rogue yearned for adventure and 
excitement, something that would add a little spice to their life.

One day, while out on a stroll, our rogue stumbled upon a group of thieves in 
the midst of a heist. Intrigued by their swift movements and agility, our rogue 
decided to follow them. The thieves were impressed by our rogue's skills and 
took them under their wing, teaching them the art of thievery.

Our rogue quickly became one of the best thieves in the group, and eventually 
struck out on their own. Using their cow herding job as a cover, our rogue 
began to steal from the wealthy merchants and nobles that passed through their village.

With each successful heist, our rogue became bolder and more confident. They 
began to travel to nearby towns and cities, always taking care to keep their 
herding job as a cover.

Years went by, and our rogue's reputation as a master thief began to grow. They 
became known as the "Milkboy" a name that struck fear into the hearts of 
merchants and nobles throughout the land.

Despite the danger that came with their chosen profession, our rogue was content. 
They had found the adventure and excitement they had been searching for, and they 
were finally living life on their own terms.

As our half-elf rogue continued to hone their skills as a thief, they began to 
attract the attention of some of the most powerful and dangerous criminals in the
 land. One such criminal was a notorious gang leader known as the Black Viper.

The Black Viper was a shadowy figure who operated from the shadows, controlling 
a vast criminal empire that spanned the entire region. Our rogue had heard rumors
 of the Black Viper's activities, but had always avoided crossing paths with 
 the gang leader.

That changed one fateful night, when our rogue attempted to steal a valuable 
gemstone from a wealthy merchant's estate. Unbeknownst to our rogue, the 
gemstone was also being targeted by the Black Viper.

As our rogue made their way through the estate, they were ambushed by a group 
of the Black Viper's henchmen. A fierce battle ensued, with our rogue using
 their expert thief skills to outmaneuver their attackers.

Despite their best efforts, however, our rogue was eventually overpowered and 
captured by the Black Viper himself. The gang leader was impressed by our rogue's 
skills, and offered them a deal - join the Black Viper's gang, and become one 
of the most powerful and feared thieves in the land.

Our rogue was torn. On the one hand, joining the Black Viper's gang would mean
 giving up their independence and freedom. On the other hand, it would also offer 
 them the chance to achieve untold riches and power.

In the end, our rogue decided to accept the Black Viper's offer. They became 
one of the gang's most trusted lieutenants, using their skills as a cow herder 
and a master thief to pull off some of the most daring and lucrative heists in
 the region.

But even as they rose through the ranks of the Black Viper's gang, our rogue 
never forgot their humble roots as a cow herder. They continued to tend to their 
family's cows, even as they plotted and schemed with some of the most dangerous 
criminals in the land.

And though they had achieved wealth and power beyond their wildest dreams, our
 rogue knew that they would always be a cow herder at heart.

% \chapter{\RED{The Shepherd}}

% A light breeze rolled over endless locks of grass as Rohan Yueh gazed out over 
% the valley that laid below. The wind rippled the lush foliage in an almost hypnotic 
% fashion, as if it intended to put onlookers into a deep trance. Snow capped mountains
% surrounded Rohan on all sides, towering over the town of Bergstadt that lay at 
% the center of the valley formed by the towering cliffs. The lad couldn't help but 
% marvel at the sight before him, even though it was one he had seen his entire life. 
% Nature had certainly blessed these lands.

% Rohan was startled by a firm nudge that came at his back. Turning around, he found 
% the nudge came from a light brown cow. The cow had a fairly shaggy mane that hung off 
% it's stocky frame and covered the creature's eyes just the ever so slightly. Small but pronounced 
% antlers protruded from it's head; not enough to cause significant injury but large 
% enough to defend from potential attackers. Several scores of other cows mingled behind 
% the one that interrupted Rohan's daydreaming. All of them looked expectedly at him.

% "Ok, ok Halifax", Rohan said. "I get the message".

% Rohan stood up from the little patch of grass he had picked out next to the mountain 
% trail, wiping away drops of water that had accumultated from the mountain air. From 
% the ground he also retrieved his family's heirloom instrument: a well weathered set 
% of bagpipes. Rohan placed the bag of the pipes under his arm and positioned the 
% mouthpiece.

% "I guess it's time to go", he thought.

% Rohan drew a breath in before playing a few test notes through the instrument. Once warmed up,
% he looked back again to the herd of cows. All of them continued to look expectantly at him.
% Rohan wheeled around and began to march down the mountain path. He started in on a 
% tune as he marched, the notes ringing out for the entire mountain valley to hear. As 
% he marched, the herd of cows began to march with him. Rohan didn't need to look back 
% to confirm that they were following; this was something they had done hundreds of times 
% before and knew what was necessary. Rohan was part of a special group that managed 
% the herds, amongst other duties. Members of this group were elite cow handlers, 
% able to expertly guide the bovine creatures through the harshest of 
% conditions. For Rohan Yeuh was a Milkboy.

% \chapter{\RED{The Thief}}

% It took Rohan another one and a half hours to arrive in Bergstadt, belting out 
% song after song on his bagpipes the entire way there. Once there, Rohan handed off the herd to 
% a set of farmers he worked with on the edge of town. He was only a Milkboy, assisting 
% the dairy farmers to make sure the cows were well fed and stimulated. Rohan did 
% not actually own any of the cows. In fact, Rohan did not own much.

% Bergstadt was a moderatly large town, with a population of roughly 4,000 people. The town 
% had everything one might expect from a much larger one: markets, bars, theatres, tavern halls,
% and much more. Bergstadt has it's share of the ultra rich, the barons of the cow trade that 
% made the town what it was today, and it had it's share of the poor, desperately struggling 
% to make ends meet.

% Rohan made his way through the cobblestone streets to small hole in the wall bar. Along the side 
% in an alley was a small door. Rohan glanced around himself before quickly unlocking and opening it, entering,
% and closing it shut. Directly inside was a small staircase leading to the floor above
% the bar. Rohan hurridly ascended the stairs, stashing his belongings in a chest at 
% the top of the stairs.

% Rohan glanced outside to see that night had finally fallen and darkness was now the 
% norm. Clouds blotted out the sky, masking the light from the moon and stars alike.

% "Perfect conditions", he thought.

% From the same chest he had stored items in, he pulled out a pitch black outfit. The outfit
% was complete with slipper like shoes and a black head covering; the perfect outfit 
% for one who might not want to be seen. Rohan donned the outfit and pulled out another 
% item from the chest: a well worn leather wrap. Inside was a lockpick set that would 
% make any locksmith weep. The picks were also well worn, obviously having had a history 
% with hundreds if not thousands of keyholes.

% Rohan tucked the lockpick set inside an opening in his tunic. He glanced around the 
% room once before turning his attention back to the window. Streetlights had now been 
% lit below, casting a dim orange glow every 5 meters or so on the street. Rohan slowly 
% opened the window and peered up and down the street. Seeing no one, he grabbed the 
% edge of the roof in front of him and pulled himself out of the window. Using the extreme
% dexterity of a seasoned climber, he flipped his legs out and then over on top the roof.

% Rohan rose into a half crouch on the roof, looking again to make sure no one had seen 
% him. Satisfied no eyes were upon him, he took off running across the roof towards the
% center of town. Not a soul was aware of his presence on the rooftops; Rohan was an 
% expert at moving quickly and silently.

% Eventually Rohan slowed to a light job and then to a walk. He had made it to the center 
% of town where only the most wealthy could afford to live. He started to pay more attention 
% to the numbers on the houses he was carefully moving over.
