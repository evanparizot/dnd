\chapter{\RED{The Shepherd}}

A light breeze rolled over endless locks of grass as Rohan Yueh gazed out over 
the valley that laid below. The wind rippled the lush foliage in an almost hypnotic 
fashion, as if it intended to put onlookers into a deep trance. Snow capped mountains
surrounded Rohan on all sides, towering over the town of Bergstadt that lay at 
the center of the valley formed by the towering cliffs. The lad couldn't help but 
marvel at the sight before him, even though it was one he had seen his entire life. 
Nature had certainly blessed these lands.

Rohan was startled by a firm nudge that came at his back. Turning around, he found 
the nudge came from a light brown cow. The cow had a fairly shaggy mane that hung off 
it's stocky frame and covered the creature's eyes just the ever so slightly. Small but pronounced 
antlers protruded from it's head; not enough to cause significant injury but large 
enough to defend from potential attackers. Several scores of other cows mingled behind 
the one that interrupted Rohan's daydreaming. All of them looked expectedly at him.

"Ok, ok Halifax", Rohan said. "I get the message".

Rohan stood up from the little patch of grass he had picked out next to the mountain 
trail, wiping away drops of water that had accumultated from the mountain air. From 
the ground he also retrieved his family's heirloom instrument: a well weathered set 
of bagpipes. Rohan placed the bag of the pipes under his arm and positioned the 
mouthpiece.

"I guess it's time to go", he thought.

Rohan drew a breath in before playing a few test notes through the instrument. Once warmed up,
he looked back again to the herd of cows. All of them continued to look expectantly at him.
Rohan wheeled around and began to march down the mountain path. He started in on a 
tune as he marched, the notes ringing out for the entire mountain valley to hear. As 
he marched, the herd of cows began to march with him. Rohan didn't need to look back 
to confirm that they were following; this was something they had done hundreds of times 
before and knew what was necessary. Rohan was part of a special group that managed 
the herds, amongst other duties. Members of this group were elite cow handlers, 
able to expertly guide the bovine creatures through the harshest of 
conditions. For Rohan Yeuh was a Milkboy.

\chapter{\RED{The Thief}}

It took Rohan another one and a half hours to arrive in Bergstadt, belting out 
song after song on his bagpipes the entire way there. Once there, Rohan handed off the herd to 
a set of farmers he worked with on the edge of town. He was only a Milkboy, assisting 
the dairy farmers to make sure the cows were well fed and stimulated. Rohan did 
not actually own any of the cows. In fact, Rohan did not own much.

Bergstadt was a moderatly large town, with a population of roughly 4,000 people. The town 
had everything one might expect from a much larger one: markets, bars, theatres, tavern halls,
and much more. Bergstadt has it's share of the ultra rich, the barons of the cow trade that 
made the town what it was today, and it had it's share of the poor, desperately struggling 
to make ends meet.

Rohan made his way through the cobblestone streets to small hole in the wall bar. Along the side 
in an alley was a small door. Rohan glanced around himself before quickly unlocking and opening it, entering,
and closing it shut. Directly inside was a small staircase leading to the floor above
the bar. Rohan hurridly ascended the stairs, stashing his belongings in a chest at 
the top of the stairs.

Rohan glanced outside to see that night had finally fallen and darkness was now the 
norm. Clouds blotted out the sky, masking the light from the moon and stars alike.

"Perfect conditions", he thought.

From the same chest he had stored items in, he pulled out a pitch black outfit. The outfit
was complete with slipper like shoes and a black head covering; the perfect outfit 
for one who might not want to be seen. Rohan donned the outfit and pulled out another 
item from the chest: a well worn leather wrap. Inside was a lockpick set that would 
make any locksmith weep. The picks were also well worn, obviously having had a history 
with hundreds if not thousands of keyholes.

Rohan tucked the lockpick set inside an opening in his tunic. He glanced around the 
room once before turning his attention back to the window. Streetlights had now been 
lit below, casting a dim orange glow every 5 meters or so on the street. Rohan slowly 
opened the window and peered up and down the street. Seeing no one, he grabbed the 
edge of the roof in front of him and pulled himself out of the window. Using the extreme
dexterity of a seasoned climber, he flipped his legs out and then over on top the roof.

Rohan rose into a half crouch on the roof, looking again to make sure no one had seen 
him. Satisfied no eyes were upon him, he took off running across the roof towards the
center of town. Not a soul was aware of his presence on the rooftops; Rohan was an 
expert at moving quickly and silently.

Eventually Rohan slowed to a light job and then to a walk. He had made it to the center 
of town where only the most wealthy could afford to live. He started to pay more attention 
to the numbers on the houses he was carefully moving over.
